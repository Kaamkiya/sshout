sshout
======

How it'll work
==============
Users can connect with their username/password.
The server will host an SQLite database with all messages. Once connected,
users are put in the #main channel by default. To switch channels, they can
type /chan [channel]. If the channel doesn't exist, it will be created.

Users' prompt will use this format:
	[user in #channel]:

List of commands
----------------
/chan [channel]       Switch to a channel. Channels will be created if they don't
                      already exist.
/help                 Print some helpful information.
/users                List all users.
/theme [theme]        Change color scheme.
/pronouns [pronouns]  Set your pronouns.
/bio [bio]            A short biography about yourself.
/exit                 Leave the chat.
/whois [user]         Get information about another user (pronouns, bio).
/kick [user]          (Admin) kill a user's SSH session.

pseudocode
----------

	import ssh, wish, fmt, slog

	srv = wish.newserver
		withaddress     localhost:2222
		withbanner      sshout (figlet)
		withidletimeout 300 sec
		withpasswdauth  func(p passwdauthhandler) ->
					u = db.get(users where name = ctx.User)
					if bcrypt.cmphashpasswd(u, p.entered)
						return true
					return false
		withversion     const version
		withmiddleware  chat // see below

	srv.serve()

	middleware chat = newmiddleware ->
		input = readline
		if input.split[0] in commands
			execCommand
		else
			sendMsg input
